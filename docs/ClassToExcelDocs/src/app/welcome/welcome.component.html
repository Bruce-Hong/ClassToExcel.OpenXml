                - Reads everything as a string with no coversion at all. Keep in mind that Excel does NOT require that BLANK cells be written
                so rows will not always have every column in the Excel data!</li>

              <a href="./reading/ClassToExcelRowConverter.htm">Reading Excel files with the ClassToExcelRawReaderService and ClassToExcelRowConverter</a>
              - The ClassToExcelRowConverter can be used in conjunction with the ClassToExcelRawReaderService and the ClassToExcelRowAttribute
              to map several rows onto a single class. I don't expect this to be used very often, but there are a few edge
              cases where I needed to do somethhing like read rows 1 - 4 to one class and rows 5 - 8 into another class.
